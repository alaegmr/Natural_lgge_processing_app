## ðŸ“Œ Project Description (NLP Domain)

This project applies **Arabic Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for text normalization. It integrates **Farasa** tools to perform:

- **Stemming** â†’ reducing words to their root form.  
- **Lemmatization** â†’ reducing words to their dictionary form.  
- **Stopword removal & vocabulary extraction** â†’ generating a clean set of unique tokens.

The processed corpus can be directly used in **NLP and LLM applications**, such as text classification, search & retrieval, embeddings, and RAG pipelines, by improving consistency and reducing vocabulary sparsity.
